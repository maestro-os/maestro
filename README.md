# About

Maestro is a lightweight Unix-like kernel written in Rust.

The goal is to provide a lightweight operating system able to use the safety features of the Rust language to be reliable.

> This project is still in early stage development, thus it is highly unstable and misses a lot of features. **Do not use it in production!**

To stay updated with the project, follow the [blog](https://blog.lenot.re)!

# Quickstart

This repository is not a full operating system in itself but only the kernel.

You can either:
- Use the [installer](https://github.com/maestro-os/maestro-install) to build a full operating system from an ISO file
- Build the OS by hand. For this, you can check the kernel's book

The OS can then be run by a virtual machine such a **QEMU** or **VirtualBox**, or on a physical machine.



## Build

To build and/or run the OS, `cd` into the kernel's crate:

```sh
cd kernel/
```

Then follow the instructions in [README.md](kernel/README.md)



## Documentation

The kernel's book contains general information on how to use the kernel.

> `mdbook` and `mdbook-mermaid` are required:
> 
> ```sh
> cargo install mdbook mdbook-mermaid
> ```

Build the book with:

```sh
mdbook-mermaid install doc/
mdbook build doc/
```

Then, it can be accessed at `doc/book/index.html`.
