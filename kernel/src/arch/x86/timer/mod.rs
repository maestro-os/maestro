//! x86 timers implementation.
//!
//! The following timers are available:
//! - PIT (legacy)
//! - RTC (legacy)
//! - APIC
//! - HPET
//!
//! If the APIC is present, its timer shall be used for scheduling. If not, the kernel fallbacks on
//! the PIT.
//!
//! Since we do not know the frequency of the APIC timer, we need to use another timer with a known
//! frequency to measure it. This is called **calibration**.
//!
//! The kernel will attempt to detect the presence of an HPET.
//!
//! TODO: if the HPET is net present, fallback on the PIT

// TODO calibrate the TSC if present and use it for timekeeping.
// If the TSC is unavailable, fallback in this order:
// - HPET
// - APIC
// - RTC
// - PIT
