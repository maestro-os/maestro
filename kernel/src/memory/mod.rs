//! The memory is one of the main component of the system.
//!
//! This module handles almost every memory-related features, including physical
//! memory map retrieving, memory allocation, virtual memory management, ...
//!
//! The system's memory is divided in two chunks:
//! - Userspace: Virtual memory below `PROCESS_END`, used by the currently running process
//! - Kernelspace: Virtual memory above `KERNEL_BEGIN`, used by the kernel itself and shared across
//!   processes
