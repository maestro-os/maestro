//! Selftesting are unit tests or integration tests that run on the kernel itself.
//!
//! # Issues
//!
//! Since the kernel cannot reset itself between each test, this method of testing might not be
//! entirely trustable because a test might corrupt the environment for the next tests, which might
//! make them pass even though they should not. Even if this scenario is unlikely, this remains a
//! concern since the kernel has to be as reliable as possible.
