//! Mutually exclusive access primitive implementation.
//!
//! A [`Mutex`] protects its wrapped data from being accessed concurrently, avoid data races.
//!
//! One particularity with kernel development is that multi-threading is not the
//! only way to get concurrency issues. Another factor to take into account is
//! that fact that an interruption may be triggered at any moment, unless disabled.
//!
//! For this reason, mutexes in the kernel are equipped with an option allowing to disable
//! interrupts while being locked.
//!
//! If an exception is raised while a mutex that disables interruptions is
//! acquired, the behaviour is undefined.
