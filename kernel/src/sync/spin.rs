//! Mutually exclusive access primitive based on a spinlock.
//!
//! A [`Spin`] protects its wrapped data from being accessed concurrently, avoid data races.
//!
//! One particularity with kernel development is that multi-threading is not the
//! only way to get concurrency issues. An interruption may be triggered at any moment.
//!
//! For this reason, spinlocks in the kernel are equipped with an option allowing to disable
//! non-maskable interrupts while being locked.
