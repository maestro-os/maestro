//! Time management implementation.
//!
//! A clock is an object that gives the current time. A distinction has to be made between:
//! - Hardware Clocks, which are physical components (from the point of view of the kernel) which
//!   give the ability to measure the passage of time, notably by producing interruptions at a
//!   given frequency.
//! - Software Clocks, which maintain a timestamp based on hardware clocks.
